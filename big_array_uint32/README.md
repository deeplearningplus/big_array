### Explanation for converting big_array_uint8/big_array.c to get it work for uint16

Data Type Update: All instances of uint8_t have been changed to uint16_t.

Size Calculations: Adjustments to size calculations to account for the 2-byte size of uint16_t elements.

SIMD Processing: SIMD processing is adjusted to handle 16 uint16_t elements (32 bytes) at a time.


[big_array_data.py](./big_array_data.py): generate a big array in python.

[big_array.c](./big_array.c): C functions to read big array.

[example_usage.py](./example_usage.py): Example usage of using C functions in python.

[Makefile](./Makefile): Compile `big_array.c` as a shared library.
